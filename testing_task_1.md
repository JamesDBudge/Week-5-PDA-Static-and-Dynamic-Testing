### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.
```ruby

class CardGame


  def checkforAce(card)
    if card.value = 1
      return true
    else
      return false
    end
  end

  dif highest_card(card1 card2) #dif should be def. missing comma in arguments
  if card1.value > card2.value
    return card
  else
    return card2
  end
end
end
#the next method is outside the class even after you fix the dif to def above
def self.cards_total(cards)
  total #pretty sure this will cause an error without setting it to something
  for card in cards
    total += card.value
    return "You have a total of" + total #probably need a space for formatting at the end of the string, also it will return after looking at one card, also need .to_s for the total
  end
end
```
